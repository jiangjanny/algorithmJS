/*
* Time and Space are the concerns
* 1. We care about how much time it takes for an algorithms to finish a task. The less time it takes, the better it is.
* 2. Timing our code's runtime is not realistic in terms of analysis Why?
* 3. Same computer gets different runtime for the same task.
* 4. Different computing power machine gives different run time for the same task.
